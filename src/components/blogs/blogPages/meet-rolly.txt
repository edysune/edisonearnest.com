Rolly is not just any dog; he's a bundle of joy, energy, and love, wrapped in a straightend coat of gold. Born on April 21st 2021, he's currently about 2.5 years old as of this post. He loves meeting new people and has been super friendly and fun since we first met (July of 2022). We instantly fell in love with him and his excited and curious nature. He does have his quirks though!</p><p><br></p><h1><strong>Rolly's Commandments!</strong></h1><ol><li>Don't be dogs Rolly doesn't like</li><li>Don't linger when checking Rolly's private zones</li><li>Give Rolly treatos</li><li>Take Rolly to the dog park</li><li>When in doubt, check underneath the car for kitties</li></ol><p><br></p><p>While Rolly loves going to the dog park to make friends, he also has other agendas... to make enemies. Rolly has very strong personal space values, and sometimes big scary dogs will set Rolly off. Luckily he's all bark and no bite!</p><p><br></p><h1><strong>Trick Certification:</strong></h1><ul><li>Shake</li><li>Sit</li><li>Down</li><li>Up</li><li>Spin (with a bit of extra coaching)</li></ul><p><br></p>
