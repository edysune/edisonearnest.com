<p>Meet Rolly, a Labradoodle with a heart as golden as his hair. Rolly is not just any dog; he's a bundle of joy, energy, and love, wrapped in a straightend coat of gold. Born on April 21st 2021, he's currently about 2.5 years old as of this post. He loves meeting new people and has been super friendly and fun since we first met (July of 2022). We instantly fell in love with him and his excited and curious nature. From the moment he set his paws in our home, he's filled it with happiness and laughter.</p>
