# EdisonEarnest.com SourceCode
This is the source-code to my website. I keep this in case anyone cares, but I mostly do this all for fun.

## Development server
Run `npm run start` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Build
Run `npm run build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Running unit tests
Run `npm run test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).
